	Let's take a look at implementing a dynamic scheduling system
	for Mendix. The subject of scheduling is quite extensive, but
	all we're interested in initially is to get some form of control
	over scheduled events in Mendix. MBM side, there are some quick
	click features in the modeler to set up scheduled events, but these
	are static, i.e. once they're set up theres not much you can do afterwards.
	Using the vinalla features provided, if you want to exercise more control,
	you have to set up lots of extra tables, pollers, and microflows.
</p>
<p>
	Using <code>java</code> <code>Runnables</code>,
	<code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutors</code> and <code>HashMaps</code>, a few front
	end interfaces, and minimal tables, you can set up a scheduling system whereby
	you can choose any Microflow to execute at a fixed or periodic intervals
	in a controlled fashion as well as control the schedules. The database
	tables are purely for front end interaction and are all nonpersitent.
</p>
<p>
	The first step is to set up a Java Action with a static <code>HashMap</code>
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">...
private static java.util.LinkedHashMap&lt;
	java.lang.String,
	java.lang.Object
&gt; hashmap=new java.util.LinkedHashMap&lt;
	java.lang.String,
	java.lang.Object
&gt;();
...</code></pre>
<p>
	This will be used to store
	<code>java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> instances,
	which we can then retrieve at some later point for control,
	like rescheduling or cancellation, as well as for populating our
	nonpersistent entities for our front end interface. The <code>key</code> is a
	<code>java.lang.String</code> which you can populate for unique identification
	purposes, for example the name of the Microflow followed by a <code>uuid</code>.
	Alternatively you can use a tuple with the microflow name and <code>uuid</code>.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>HashMap</code> will be used in more than one Java Action, so
	we'll implement it in a seperate class, and include that as member in those
	actions. The actions involved will be for <i>creating</i>, <i>manipulating</i>,
	and <i>listing all</i> schedules. With those three actions we will be able
	to manipulate scheduled execution to a great enough extent for it to be usable.
</p>
<p>
	In order to create a schedule for a Microflow, we'll pass in two parameters,
	the fully qualified name of the Microflow, and a cron string. If you've worked
	in <code>*nix</code> you might be familiar with the syntax for <code>cron</code>,
	which is a scheduling tool that comes standard on <code>*nix</code>..
</p>
<p>
	Very is involved in this general purpose <code>Schedule</code> class, and
	it should in fact be named somthing different, at is so general purpose
	that it can be reused for lots of things
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">package mxutil;
public class Schedule{
	public Schedule(){}
	public java.util.LinkedHashMap&lt;
		java.lang.String,
		java.lang.Object
	&gt; getSchedule(){
		return hashmap;
	}
	public static java.util.LinkedHashMap&lt;
		java.lang.String,
		java.lang.Object
	&gt; hashmap=new java.util.LinkedHashMap&lt;
		java.lang.String,
		java.lang.Object
	&gt;();
}</code></pre>
<p>
	Before we get started with the scheduling itself, in order to make setting up
	schedules easier, we need a way of parsing the <code>cron</code> strings.
	We can use <a href="https://github.com/jmrozanec/cron-utils">jmrozanec/cron-utils</a>
	for this, which you can find as a prebuilt jar at Maven, however
	<code>org.springframework</code> has <code>org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskSchduler</code> and <code>org.springframework.scheduling.support.Crontrigger</code>
	that really works very nicely together to set up you <code>cron</code> jobs.
