<p>
	<code>cpp</code> is the <code>c</code> preprocssor.
	It includes header files, does macro expansion,
	conditional compilation and line processing.
	When you use the <code>gcc</code> front end
	to compile your <code>c</code> programs,
	<code>gcc</code> is used in the sequence of
	steps taken to produce your binaries or
	objects.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>cpp</code> directives are weakly related to the
	<code>c</code> language, which means you can use it to
	process other types of files, not necessarily
	<code>c</code> source files.
</p>
<p>
	The following <code>makefile</code> uses <code>cpp</code>
	explicitly to produce an intermediate for compilation
	and assembly.

<p>
	The file <code>./src/a.i</code> will be quite extensive
	with all the preprocessor directives expanded
</p>
<pre><code class="language-c"># 1 "./src/a.c"

...
int main(int argc,char** argv){
...
}</code></pre>
<p>
	<code>c</code> compilation consists of eight phases, and the
	job of the <code>preprocessor</code> is defined in the first 
	four of those phases.
</p>
<h3>
	#include
</h3>
<p>
	There are numerous preprocessor directives that are meant to
	be handled by <code>cpp</code>, the most common is
	<code>#include</code>.
</p>
<p>
	<code>cpp</code> is commonly used to include other files, normally
	headers with function declarations and constants. If you take a look
	at some of the header files in <code>/usr/include</code> you'll
	see that they can also include other header files.
</p>
<p>
	In the above example <i>hello world</i>, the <code>printf</code>
	function is declared in <code>stdio.h</code>, located at 
	<code>/usr/include/stdio.h</code>, and included via the proprocessor
	by using the <code>#include</code> preprocessor directive.
	Instead of using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>
	characters with <code>#include</code>, we can use <code>"</code>
	characters. When using the chevrons, it implies that the
	file to be included will be searched for in the standard
	compiler include paths, whereas if the double quotes are used
	the file will searched for in the local include directories,
	which will be the <code>cwd</code> and any optional directories
	as specified by the <code>-I</code> flag passed to the
	front-end (<code>gcc</code>) or by specific environmental variables.
</p>
<p>
	When including files, you run the risk of including them multiple
	times which may result in errors further down the line. 
	<code>#pragma once</code> can be used to prevent this, or more
	commonly the following
</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#ifndef FOO_H
#define FOO_H
...
#endif</code></pre>
<p>
	<code>#pragma</code>, <code>#ifndef</code>, and <code>#define</code>
	are example of some more preprocessor directives specifically
	handled by <code>cpp</code> in the compilation process.
</p>
<p>
	Conditional compilation can be facilitated with the <code>#if</code>
	and <code>#endif</code> preprocessor directives. You'll be
	interested in using these for example if you want have a programming
	with logging for debug purposes and want to be able to turn
	the debugging statements on or off
</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#if _DEBUG
	printf("i:%d\n",i);
#endif</code></pre>
<p>
	You can add the definition for <code>DEBUG</code> somewhere
	in the source code using <code>#define DEBUG</code> or as
	a flag to the compiler, for example <code>gcc -DDEBUG</code>.
</p>
<p>
	You also need this sort of control if you're writing multiplatform
	source code, for example dealing with <code>osx</code>,
	<code>linux</code>, <code>windows</code>, etc. There are some
	standard things defined by the front end/compiler, and among
	these are definitions for the operating system, for example
	<code>#define WIN32</code> will be automatically there if you
	are using a <code>_WIN32</code> compiler like <code>mingw</code>
	which you can use in your source code for this sort of thing
	without explicitly having to add it somewhere else.
</p>
<h3>
	macro expansion
</h3>
<p>
	Macros are pieces of source code handled by the preprocessor
	which for example substitues sections of it, almost like templating.
	You can <i>function like</i> macros and <i>object-like</i> macros.
	The basic syntax is as follows
</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">//function like
#define &lt;identifier&gt;(&lt;parameter list&gt;) &lt;replacement token list&gt;
//object-like
#define &lt;identifier&gt; &lt;replacement token list&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
	Distribution of whitespace is relevant in these two forms
	and should be adhered to, the important part being that in
	the <i>function-like</i> macro there is no space between
	<code>identifier</code> and the <code>(</code> character.
</p>
<p>
	An example of a <i>function-like</i> macro might be as follows
</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define RADTODEG(x) ((x)*57.29578)</code></pre>
<p>
	The <i>function-like</i> macros are used often to create more
	efficient code, as there is no function call overhead
	with the inline substituting performed by the preprocessor.
