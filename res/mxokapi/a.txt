 Okapi Barcode License Maven Central Build Status

Okapi Barcode is an open-source barcode generator written entirely in
Java, supporting over 50 encoding standards, including all ISO standards.
Okapi Barcode is based on Zint, an open-source barcode encoding library
developed in C, and builds on the years of work that have been invested
in that project.

 Library Usage

To generate barcode images in your own code using the Okapi Barcode
library, use one of the symbology classes linked above:

 1. instantiate the class,
 2. customize any relevant settings,
 3. invoke setContent(String), and then
 4. pass the symbol instance to one of the available symbol renderers (
    Java 2D, PostScript, SVG)

Code128 barcode = new Code128();
barcode.setFontName("Monospaced");
barcode.setFontSize(16);
barcode.setModuleWidth(2);
barcode.setBarHeight(50);
barcode.setHumanReadableLocation(HumanReadableLocation.BOTTOM);
barcode.setContent("123456789");

int width = barcode.getWidth();
int height = barcode.getHeight();

BufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_BYTE_GRAY);
Graphics2D g2d = image.createGraphics();
Java2DRenderer renderer = new Java2DRenderer(g2d, 1, Color.WHITE, Color.BLACK);
renderer.render(barcode);

ImageIO.write(image, "png", new File("code128.png"));

Okapi Barcode JARs are available for download from Maven Central.

 GUI Usage

To use the Swing GUI, just run the OkapiUI class. The GUI allows you to
explore the supported barcode symbologies and test them with different
configurations and data.

 Building

gradlew check: Compiles and runs all quality checks, including the unit
tests.
gradlew jar: Builds the JAR file.
gradlew uploadArchives: Deploys to Maven Central (requires a modified
gradle.properties file).

NOTE: The unit tests should all pass under Oracle JDK, but will probably
not all pass under OpenJDK. The tests verify barcode rendering image
output, and the output images generated by OpenJDK are a bit different
from the output images generated by the Oracle JDK (because their 2D
graphics and font subsystems are slightly different).
