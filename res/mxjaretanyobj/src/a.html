	The title of this post is slightly misleading. In Mendix
	there is some difference between the MBM Ide and the mendix
	runtime in terms of what you can do. For example, if you 
	create in MBM a java action that takes an object, MBM expects
	you to specify the type, and if you do not, it blocks you
	from compiling the project. There is something called a <i>TypeParameter</i>, which was taken out for a few versions, and then put back in for you to use. The <i>TypeParameter</i> allows you to select any object type
	as input parameter to your java action.
</p>
<p>
	If you take a look at the java, <i>TypeParameters</i> are of type <code>com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.IMendixObject</code>. All Mendix objects have this as their base class.
</p>
<p>
	Using <i>TypeParameter</i> types are very useful and makes
	your java actions more reusable. You'll find that lots of java actions by Mendix
	and other parties use the <i>TypeParameter</i> types as input
	parameters, which puts forward the question
	<i>"How can we return any type"?</i>
</p>
<p>
	In regular programming you would either return a <i>base-class</i> or <i>void</i> pointer type. You could also pass in variables by reference or pointers to variables as parameters and manipulate them.
</p>
<p>
	A solution in Mendix to this that provides lots of flexibility is
	to reflect into the <i>action-stack</i>, which is a
	<code>java.util.ArrayList</code> containing
	<code>com.mendix.modules.microflowengine.microflow.impl.MicroflowImpl</code>
</p>
<p>
	<i>Action-stack</i> elements are the actual runtime representation
	of either a <i>microflow</i> or <i>java-action</i> execution.
	If it is a <i>microflow</i>, then you can actually get at
	its parents, all its elements, meta-information, etc. One 
	of the things you can do with the elements is manipulate them.
	Wether they are lists of mendix objects, a single mendix object,
	or a simple type, you can get their value, manipulate that value
	and also set their value. You can even create objects and variables in the
	<i>microflow</i> that did not exist. Let's take a look at how we 
	can do that.
</p>
<p>
	In order to get at the <i>action-stack</i>, you can use the
	following
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var astack=getContext().getActionStack();</code></pre>
<p>
	If you are calling your <code>java</code>/<code>nashorn</code>/<code>graal</code>
	from a nested <i>microflow</i>, the <code>astack</code> <code>length</code>
	property will reflect this. The current level in the <i>action-stack</i>
	will always be <code>astack.size()-1</code>
</p>
<p>
	If you want to get at values in a calling microflow for example
	from your <code>java</code> or embedded scripting language, you
	will refer to <code>astack[astack.size()-2]</code>, which is one level up
	from your current stack level. Let's take a look at how we
	can access variables from a calling <i>microflow</i>.
</p>
<p>
	Let's say that you have a microflow <code>foo.ivk_bar</code>
	that calls a <i>java-action</i> with our code that
	manipulates the <i>action-stack</i>. Let's also assume
	that it has the following variables/objects instantiated
	prior to the execution of our <code>java</code> code.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<code>bool_test</code>: <i>A variable of <code>Integer</code></i>
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>bool_test</code>: <i>A variable of <code>Boolean</code></i>
	</li>
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>obj_test</code>: <i>An object of <code>Administartion.Account</code></i>
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>arr_test</code>: <i>An list of <code>Administartion.Account</code></i>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You can get at the values from within your <code>java</code>
	as follows
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var astack=getContext().getActionStack();
var mf=astack[astack.size()-2];
var bool_test=mf.getVariable("bool_test");
var int_test=mf.getVariable("int_test");
var obj_test=mf.getVariable("obj_test");
var arr_test=mf.getVariable("arr_test");</code></pre>
<p>
	Simple, but what is the benefit? If you have
	a pretty hardcoded setup and dont want to bother
	with the modeler and know whats going on in the microflow,
	you can just reference the variables manually in your <code>java</code> and not bother changing the interface of the action in the MBM Ide.
	You can actually implement your <i>java-action</i> interface to 
	not take parameters of the actual objects, but just their
	names, and then write your <code>java</code> code to use
	the names to reflect into the <i>action-stack</i> and get 
	at the variables by name.
</p>
<p>
	The real benefit comes in when manipulating those variables.
	For that you can use the <code>setVariable</code> method,
	but before we do that, let's take a look how we
	can actually at this point already change things.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">...
var obj_test=mf.getVariable("obj_test");
obj_test.setValue(
	getContext(),
	"foo",
	"bar"
);
...</code></pre>
<p>
	Because <code>obj_test</code> is now referring to
	an instance of <code>IMendixObject</code> we can change
	the object. If you actually go on and debug
	the <i>microflow</i>, you'll see that after the 
	<code>java</code> part has been executed the changes
	will be reflected with field <code>foo</code> set to 
	value <code>bar</code>
</p>
<p>
	For the simple <code>variable</code> types in the microflow
	we can use the <code>setVariable</code> method, which
	has an interesting behavior when the variable does not
	exist.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">...
var int_test=mf.getVariable("int_test");
mf.setVariable("int_test",int_test++);
var int_new=42;
mf.setVariable("int_new",int_new);
int_new=mf.getVariable("int_new");
mf.setVariable("int_new",int_new++);
...</code></pre>
<p>
	This will manipulate <code>int_test</code> in the 
	<i>microflow</i>, but will also create a new <code>variable</code>
	in the <i>microflow</i>, then read it in again, increment it,
	and set it again. When debugging the <i>microflow</i>
	you will magically see a new variable in the debugging console,
	even though one was not declared anywhere in the action. This
	brings us to returning <i>any type</i> from a <i>java-action</i>
</p>
<p>
	It's pretty clear that you can manipulate variables
	and objects or lists of objects from your <code>java</code>
	so returning any type will involve populating a previously
	declared object or list or variable. Simply pass in as a parameter
	to your <i>java-action</i> the name of the variable and use
	code similar to the above to manipulate that object, list, or
	variable. In fact, you can now go on an manipulate numerous
	such objects, lists, or variables, in effect not only creating
	any return type, but also numerous return types. It's not really 
	a return type/s as much as a sort of reference variable/s.
</p>
<p>
	<code>nashorn</code> and <code>graal</code> is pretty
	easy to prototype, but in <code>java</code> you'll find
	that the fact that a lot of the classes and functions are
	<code>private</code> is going to make development a bit more
	tricky. To cirumvent the java api security you can use reflection
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
java.lang.reflect.Method method;
try{
	method = astack.get(2).getClass().getMethod("getVariable",java.lang.String.class);
	try{
		java.util.List&lt;com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.IMendixObject&gt; lst=(java.util.ArrayList<com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.IMendixObject> )method.invoke(astack.get(astack.size()-2),VARNAM);
		lst.add(obj);
	}catch(Exception e){com.mendix.core.Core.getLogger(this.toString()).error(e);}
}catch (Exception e) {com.mendix.core.Core.getLogger(this.toString()).error(e);}
