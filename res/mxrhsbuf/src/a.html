	In this post we explore exposing shared buffers via request handlers.
	The basic idea is to have a request handler that reads an
	input stream and buffers it continuously. This buffer is then shared
	and made available to another request handler or request handlers
	for reading. The end result is buffer shared between request handlers.
	A possible use for this might be continual data streaming, such
	as audio or video, but the data itself is arbitrary, with possible
	specific implementation modification for textual delimited data
	and binary data. With the implementation in place, it can be modified
	for whatever specific end implementation is required.

	The first thing to do is to set up a passthrough request handler
	and test client. Setting up the test client is more difficult than
	the th test request handler, and involves creating a <i>named pipe</i>
	on some client using something like <code>mknod</code>, keeping
	it open with a dummy redirection, e.g. <code>sleep 60000 &gt; ./mypipe</code>,
	connect <code>curl</code> to it in chunked mode directed at your request
	handler, and then using another process to redirect data to the pipe.
