<p>
	For a recent request handler exposing
	operating system features, I needed
	a convenient utility to operate the
	endpoint using a command line utility.
</p>
<p>
	Then endpoint accomodates <code>GET</code>
	as well as <code>POST</code> methods
	to execute host operating system commands
</p>
<p>
	The process is configured using url
	arguments, for example the following
</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">/os?cmd=ls</code></pre>
<p>
	This will execute <code>ls</code> in some
	current working directory and print out
	a directory listing in the response. The
	arguments to the command may be specified
	as follows
</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">/os?cmd=lsampargs=-l%20/usr/bin</code></pre>
<p>
	This will execute <code>ls</code> to print
	out verbose information on the entries
	in <code>/usr/bin</code>
</p>
<p>
	The <code>POST</code> method is also
	supported, and the bahavior then
	is exactly the same with the additional
	feature of the request body being
	written the standard input stream
	of the process, for example, the following
	<code>curl</code> invocation will perform
	a <code>grep</code> for the string foo
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">printf "\
foo\n\
bar\n\
baz\n\
"|curl -F file=@- $HOT/os?cmd=grep&amp;args=foo</code></pre>
<p>
	This all works fine when testing it in
	the browser, but it would be much more
	convenient to have some command line 
	program that helps out. The following
	<code>python</code> script did just that
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/python3
import urllib.request as urllib2;
import urllib;
import sys;
def main(argv):
    args='';
    sep=' ';
    cmd=''
    if len(argv)&gt;1:
        cmd=argv[1]
    else:
        print('No command specified');
        return
    cmd=urllib2.quote(cmd)
    args=[]
    if len(argv)&gt;2:
        args=sep.join(argv[2:]);
        args=urllib2.quote(args)
    prot='https://';
    host='somesandbox.mxapps.io';
    port=443;
    endp='/os';
    url=prot+host+':'+str(port)+endp+'?cmd='+cmd;
    if len(args)&gt;0:
        url+='&amp;args='+args;
    if sys.stdin.isatty():
        req=urllib2.Request(url);
        response=urllib2.urlopen(req);
    else:
        data=sys.stdin.buffer;
        #req=urllib2.Request(url,data)
        req=urllib2.Request(url)
        req.add_header('Cache-Control','no-cache');
        req.add_header('Content-Type','application/octet-stream');
        response=urllib2.urlopen(req,data);
    print(response.read().decode());
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main(sys.argv)</code></pre>
<p>
	With this utility, <code>mxsh</code>,
	installed in <code>/usr/bin</code> you
	can then simply use invocation like the
	following
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mxsh ls /usr/bin</code></pre>
<p>
	Though piping is not supported internally,
	you can effectively (although inefficiently)
	pipe contents through consecutive invocations
	and local piping
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mxsh ls /usr/bin|mxsh grep gcc</code></pre>
<p>
	The <code>python</code> shebang is specified
	as <code>#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/python3</code> because I'm using termux to run this
	off an Android phone, which makes it
	all pretty convenient.
</p>
<p>
	Though the script is not perfect (I am
	by no means proficient in
	<code>python</code>), some effort was put
	into handling <code>stdin</code>,
	specifically binary data.
</p>
<p>
	Some <i>internal</i> commands are also
	provisioned by this rudimentary request
	handler in the form of a <code>&gt;</code>
	as well as a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> command
	that requires a single argument, which is 
	a path on the disk. The following will
	write <code>stdin</code> to
	<code>/tmp/foo.txt</code>
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ps -e|mxsh "&gt;" /tmp/foo.txt</code></pre>
<p>
	The redirection symbol was written in
	double quotes in order to avoid redirection
	in the shell executing that command.
</p>
<p>
	Exposing operating system processes is very
	dangerous ofcourse, and special attention
	should be payed to security, for example
	to add simple authentication, tokens,
	etc. This will, however, result in a little
	more work on the side of the request handler
	as well as the client program, but is well
	worth it.
