<p>
	Let's look at how we can create something of a <i>data pump</i>
	using <code>netcat</code>, <code>mknod</code> and some shell scripting.
	The idea is to set something up in the terminal that continually pumps
	out data on a port. First, make a named pipe
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mknod p ./f</code></pre>
<p>
	This will create <code>./f</code>, a named pipe. After that, lets
	keep the pipe open with the following dummy command
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sleep 60000 &gt; ./f</code></pre>
<p>
	This will keep the special file open for <code>60000</code> seconds.
	After this, lets connect <code>netcat to serve up that special file
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cat /dev/urandom|xxd|nc -l 8080</code></pre>
<p>
	This will write content out continually, piping into <code>netcat</code>,
	which will send it to port <code>8080</code> on the local machine
</p>
<p>
	You can output the content of that port from the same or from a different
	machine using the following
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc 127.0.0.1 8080</pre></code>
<p>
	If you are on a different machine, just replace the <code>ip</code>
	address with the machine on which the above is running's <code>ip</code>
	address.
</p>
<p>
	It is in fact possible to connect multiple listening instances of
	<code>netcat</code> to the port (in this case <code>8080</code>) 
	from either the same or from different machines. You can do this
	by running <code>nc 127.0.0.1 8080</code> on the same machine
	with different terminal emulators or a terminal multiplexer like
	<code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code>. In order to confirm that
	all the lines being written out on the port (that is why <code>xxd</code>
	was used to produce human identifyable output), you can limit the
	rate at which the lines are produced with the following alteration 
	to the line producer invocation
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cat /dev/urandom|xxd|pv -L 32|nc -l 8080</code></pre>
<p>
	The <code>pv</code> utility, which you can install from your distro's
	repository or build from source, is a command that can be used to
	monitor the rate at which data is being transferred, but it also has the
	feature of limiting the rate at which data goes out of it with the
	<code>-L</code> flag followed by an integer value representing the
	amount of bytes per second that will be returned from its <code>stdout</code>.
	By combining it into the invocation we can clamp the output. <code>32</code>
	bytes per second is slow enough for you to confirm on your listening 
	<code>nc</code> invocations output visually that the lines do indeed 
	match up, confirming that all lines are read by all listening instances
	and that none are skipped.
</p>
<p>
	This can kind of serve as a tool if you want to serve up arbitrary
	data for testing other things, and also to learn a bit more about
	how this sort of things works fundamentally.
