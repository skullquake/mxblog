<p>
	GNU <code>ar</code> is commonly used to
	create static archives for libraries
	compiled for example with <code>gcc</code>
	or <code>g++</code>. It can also
	modify as well as extract archives.
</p>
<p>
	The archive entries maintain the original
	permissions, timestamps, etc., and all
	this kind of meta data will be restored
	upon extraction.
</p>
<p>
	Depending on the target system <code>ar</code>
	was built for, there may be restrictions 
	on the entry names, for example the length
	and the type of characters that may be used
	for them.
</p>
<p>
	<code>ar</code> is maintained with
	<code>binutils</code> because it is used
	for archiving relocatable object modules,
	and is thus related to binary executable
	artifacts. It maintains an index related
	to the relocatable objects stored in it
	that speeds up the linking process when
	compiling a program.
</p>
<p>
	<code>ar</code> is commonly incorporated into
	build systems, such as the following
	<code>makefile</code>, in order to create
	static libraries
</p>
<pre><code class="language-makefile">CC=gcc
APPSRC=./src/a.c
APPOBJ=./bin/a.o
APPBIN=./bin/a.out
LIBSRC=./src/b.c
LIBOBJ=./bin/b.o
LIB=./lib/libb.a
CFLAGS=-I./include
all:$(APPBIN)
$(APPBIN): $(APPSRC) $(LIB)
	gcc $(CFLAGS) -L./lib $(APPSRC) -lb -o $(APPBIN)
$(LIBOBJ): $(LIBSRC)
	gcc $(CFLAGS) $(LIBSRC) -c -o $(LIBOBJ)
$(LIB): $(LIBOBJ)
	ar rcs $(LIB) $(LIBOBJ)
.phony:clean
clean:
	rm $(BIN) $(BINOBJ) $(LIB) $(LIBOBJ)</code></pre>
<p>
	The relevant line is
	<code>ar rcs $(LIB) $(LIBOBJ)</code>,
	which takes a single object and puts
	it into an archive. The common extension
	for a static archive is <code>.a</code>
</p>
<p>
	To print the contents of an archive, you
	can use <code>ar t</code> followed by
	the path to the archive.
</p>
<p>
	In the example <code>makefile</code>,
	<code>ar rcs $(LIB) $(LIBOBJ)</code>
	uses <code>r</code> to insert a file member
	int the archive, <code>c</code> to create
	the arcvhive if it does not exist, and
	<code>s</code> specifies that
	an object-file index is to be written or
	updated in the archive. There are a few
	other flags that you can read up on
	by checking out the manual page for
	<code>ar</code> by running <code>man ar</code>,
	or checking out the <code>binutils</code>
	documentation.
</p>
<p>
	To get more verbose output, you can use
	the <code>v</code> character, for example
	for a verbose listing, you can use the
	following
</p>
<pre><code class="language-makefile">ar tv ./lib/liba</code></pre>
<p>
	This will produce output similar to
	<code>ls -l</code>, as in the following
</p>
<pre><code class="language-makefile">rw------- 10184/10184   1112 Feb 25 19:58 2019 b.o</code></pre>
